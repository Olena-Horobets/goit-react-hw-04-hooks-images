User experience is crusial for developers. Pleasant modern design of application
is part of it. Here you can find the beautiful color palette, used in this app
as well as custom brand logo, which makes my app recognizable. Tasteful use of
opacity, shadows and blur creates unique style of product. Little things like
custom scrollbar and gallery preloader give the final touch to overall
impression.
